# Nakama

Source code of the next social network for anime fans. Still on development.

## Docker build

The easies way to start the server and its dependencies is by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Building

Instead of Docker, you can also install and build stuff by yourself, that way you have complete control.

So, besides having [Go](https://golang.org) installed, the server needs [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com) and [NATS](https://nats.io).

First, you need a cockroach node running.
```bash
cockroach start-single-node --insecure --host 127.0.0.1
```

Then, you need to create the database and tables.
```bash
cat schema.sql | cockroach sql --insecure
```

Then you need to start NATS server.
```bash
nats-server
```

Now, you can build and run the server.

```bash
go build
./nakama
```

Front-end doesn't need any tools or building because it's standard vanilla JavaScript ðŸ™‚
